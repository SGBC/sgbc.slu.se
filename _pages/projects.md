## Current projects

* **B3Africa**

Eleven partners from African and European countries will jointly develop a collaboration framework and an informatics infrastructure that will accelerate and facilitate biomedical research across the continents to address global health challenges together. Via the Horizon 2020 work programme the European Commission provides a budget of ~ 2 Million Euro over the period of 3 years for the B3Africa initiative.

* **DEANN**

The DEANN project is a network formation initiative that involves six research institutions and universities from four EU countries (United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain and Italy) and equivalently, six research entities from four Latin American countries (Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and Chile). The overall goal of this initiative is to strengthen research partnership among project participants by developing a shared scientific knowhow in the field of Next Generation Sequencing data analysis. This will lead to increase in the scientific competence of consortium members at the international level.

* **EMBnet**

EMBnet, The Global Bioinformatics Network, is a world-wide organisation that brings bioinformatics professionals together to serve, support and sustain the growing field of bioinformatics in the biological and biomedical research domains.

* **GOBLET**

GOBLET, the Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and T raining, is a legally registered foundation. Its mission is to: Provide a global, sustainable support and networking structure for bioinformatics educators/trainers and students/trainees (including a training portal for sharing materials, tools, tips and techniques; guidelines and best practice documents; facilities to help train the trainers; and offering different learning pathways for different types of learner).

**BBMRI-LPC**

BBMRI-LPC (Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure – Large Prospective Cohorts) is one of the largest biobanking networks in Europe aiming to facilitate scientists’ access to large prospective study sets on human health and disease.

**BCnet**

The Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) Biobank and Cohort Building Network (BCNet) initiative arose from the realization that despite improvements in developed countries, population cohorts and biobanking facilities are either underdeveloped or non-existent in LMICs.

**H3AfricaBionet**

H3ABioNet is a Pan African Bioinformatics network comprising 32 Bioinformatics research groups distributed amongst 15 African countries and 2 partner Institutions based in the USA which will support H3Africa researchers and their projects while developing Bioinformatics capacity within Africa. SGBC provides eBioKits and training.

**BECA/ILRI**

SGBC has participated in the building of a strong Bioinformatics facility at BECA, Nairobi, Kenya and gives an advanced course every year for researchers from all countries in East and Central Africa.

**Prolific**

EU Fp7 Project: “Pluridisciplinary study for a RObust and sustainabL e Improvement of F ertility In Cows” SGBC is in Charge of bioinformatics and a Experimental Management System for the projects omics data.

**BioInnovate**

The Bio-R esources Innovations N etwork for EasternA frica Development (Bio-Innovate) Program was established in 2010 to support multi-disciplinary biosciences and product oriented innovation activities in the eastern Africa countries of Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda

**Stategra**

The STATegra project aims to develop new statistical methods and tools for the integrative analysis of diverse omics data for a more efficient use of the genomics technologies. SGBC is part of the advisory board for this EU project.

**BioBankCloud**

BiobankCloud is an EU-funded FP7 project that is developing a cloud-computing platform as a service (PaaS) for the storage, analysis and inter-connection of biobank data. SGBC is part of the advisory board for this EU project.
