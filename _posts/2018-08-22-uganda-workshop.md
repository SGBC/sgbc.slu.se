Dr. Juliette Hayer, Hadrien Gourl√© and Dr. Maja Malmberg from SLU Global Bioinformatics Centre (SGBC) are in partnership with Dr. Lawrence Mugisha at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Animal Resources & Biosecurity (COVAB), Makerere University are organizing a Bioinformatics and Metagenomics Workshop from 10th-14th September 2018, at Makerere University.

The aim of the workshop is to introduce graduate students/fellows to bioinformatics and high throughput sequencing data analysis.
The workshop will consist of 4 full days of training in bioinformatics and metagenomics questions, data handling, taxonomic classification and visualization.

The workshop is funded by the Swedish Research Council (Dnr 2016-05705) and is organized as a part of the Tick-Borne Pathogens Project 2017-2019.
