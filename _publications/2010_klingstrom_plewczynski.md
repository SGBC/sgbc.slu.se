### Abstract

The amount of information regarding protein–protein interactions (PPI) at a
proteomic scale is constantly increasing. This is paralleled with an increase
of databases making information available. Consequently there are diverse ways
of delivering information about not only PPIs but also regarding the databases
themselves. This creates a time consuming obstacle for many researchers working
in the field. Our survey provides a valuable tool for researchers to reduce the
time necessary to gain a broad overview of PPI-databases and is supported by a
graphical representation of data exchange. The graphical representation is made
available in cooperation with the team maintaining www.pathguide.org and can be
accessed at http://www.pathguide.org/interactions.php in a new Cytoscape web
implementation. The local copy of Cytoscape cys file can be downloaded from
http://bio.icm.edu.pl/~darman/ppi web page.
