### Abstract

Management of data to produce scientific knowledge is a key challenge for
biological research in the 21st century. Emerging high-throughput technologies
allow life science researchers to produce big data at speeds and in amounts
that were unthinkable just a few years ago. This places high demands on all
aspects of the workflow: from data capture (including the experimental
constraints of the experiment), analysis and preservation, to peer-reviewed
publication of results. Failure to recognise the issues at each level can lead
to serious conflicts and mistakes; research may then be compromised as a result
of the publication of non-coherent protocols, or the misinterpretation of
published data. In this report, we present the results from a workshop that was
organised to create an ontological data-modelling framework for Laboratory
Protocol Standards for the Molecular Methods Database (MolMeth). The workshop
provided a set of short- and long-term goals for the MolMeth database, the most
important being the decision to use the established EXACT description of
biomedical ontologies as a starting point.
