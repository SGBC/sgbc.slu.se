### Abstract

Certain strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens can colonize plants and improve
growth and stress management. In order to study these effects, bacterial growth
dynamics on plants and in the rhizosphere are of interest calling for specific
analytical tools. For that purpose, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays
were developed in order to differentiate among three closely related
B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum strains (UCMB5033, UCMB5036, UCMB5113)
and to determine their levels with high accuracy. Oligonucleotide primers were
designed for strain unique gene sequences and used for SYBR green based qPCR
analysis. Standard curves covered a wide linear range (10(6)) of DNA amounts
with the lowest detection level at 50 fg. Post-reaction melting curve analysis
showed only a single product. Accurate threshold cycles were obtained, even in
the presence of high excess of related Bacillus strains and total bacterial DNA
from soil. Analysis of Bacillus colonisation after seed treatment of two
oilseed rape cultivars (Oase and Ritz) grown on agar support showed a time
dependent effect but that the bacteria mostly were found on root tissues and
little on green tissues. The colonisation on plants grown in soil varied among
the Bacillus strains where Oase seemed to house more bacteria than Ritz.
Applied as a mixture, all three Bacillus strains co-existed on the roots of
plants grown in soil. The qPCR assay in combination with other techniques will
be a powerful tool to study plant interactions of these B. amyloliquefaciens
biocontrol agents to further understand the requirements for successful
interactions and improvement of plant properties.
