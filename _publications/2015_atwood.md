### Abstract

In recent years, high-throughput technologies have brought big data to the life
sciences. The march of progress has been rapid, leaving in its wake a demand
for courses in data analysis, data stewardship, computing fundamentals, etc.,
a need that universities have not yet been able to satisfy—paradoxically, many
are actually closing “niche” bioinformatics courses at a time of critical need.
The impact of this is being felt across continents, as many students and
early-stage researchers are being left without appropriate skills to manage,
analyse, and interpret their data with confidence. This situation has
galvanised a group of scientists to address the problems on an international
scale. For the first time, bioinformatics educators and trainers across the
globe have come together to address common needs, rising above institutional
and international boundaries to cooperate in sharing bioinformatics training
expertise, experience, and resources, aiming to put ad hoc training practices
on a more professional footing for the benefit of all.
