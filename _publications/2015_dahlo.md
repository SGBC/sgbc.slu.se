### Abstract

Virtualization is becoming increasingly important in bioscience, enabling
assembly and provisioning of complete computer setups, including operating
system, data, software, and services packaged as virtual machine images (VMIs).
We present an open catalog of VMIs for the life sciences, where scientists can
share information about images and optionally upload them to a server equipped
with a large file system and fast Internet connection. Other scientists can
then search for and download images that can be run on the local computer or
in a cloud computing environment, providing easy access to bioinformatics
environments. We also describe applications where VMIs aid life science
research, including distributing tools and data, supporting reproducible
analysis, and facilitating education. BioImg.org is freely available at:
https://bioimg.org.
