### Abstract

Members of the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster’ represent important livestock
pathogens worldwide. Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides is the etiologic agent
of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), which is still endemic in many
parts of Africa. We report the genome sequences and annotation of two
frequently used challenge strains of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides,
Afadé and B237. The information provided will enable downstream ‘omics’
applications such as proteomics, transcriptomics and reverse vaccinology
approaches. Despite the absence of Mycoplasma pneumoniae like cyto-adhesion
encoding genes, the two strains showed the presence of protrusions. This
phenotype is likely encoded by another set of genes.
