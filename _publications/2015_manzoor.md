### Abstract

Syntrophaceticus schinkii strain Sp3 is a mesophilic syntrophic acetate
oxidizing bacterium, belonging to the Clostridia class within the phylum
Firmicutes, originally isolated from a mesophilic methanogenic digester. It has
been shown to oxidize acetate in co-cultivation with hydrogenotrophic
methanogens forming methane. The draft genome shows a total size of
3,196,921 bp, encoding 3,688 open reading frames, which includes 3,445
predicted protein-encoding genes and 55 RNA genes. Here, we are presenting
assembly and annotation features as well as basic genomic properties of the
type strain Sp3.
