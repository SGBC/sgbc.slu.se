### Abstract

‘Treponema phagedenis’ is considered to be a key agent in the pathogenesis of
bovine digital dermatitis, an infectious foot condition of economic and animal
welfare importance. We hereby report the draft sequence of ‘T. phagedenis’
strain V1. The draft genome assembly consists of 51 scaffolds comprising
3,129,551 bp and a GC-content of 39.9 %. Putative pathogenicity related factors
have been identified in the genome that can be used in future studies to gain
insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of ‘T. phagedenis’.
