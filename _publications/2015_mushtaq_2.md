### Abstract

**Background**  
The genus Brachyspira currently encompasses seven valid species that colonize
the intestines of mammals and birds. In a previous study a group of strongly
haemolytic isolates from pigs and mallards was provisionally described as a
new species within genus Brachyspira, “B. suanatina”, and enteropathogenic
properties were demonstrated in a porcine challenge model.

**Methods**  
In the current study characterization of B. suanatina was performed on the
basis of cell morphology, growth characteristics, enzyme profiles, DNA-DNA
hybridization (DDH) and whole genome comparisons. The draft genome sequence of
B. suanatina strain AN4859/03 was determined and compared with the available
genomes of all valid species of Brachyspira.

**Results**  
According to morphological traits, growth characteristics and enzymatic
profiles, B. suanatina was similar to the type strain of B. hyodysenteriae,
but using the recommended threshold value of 70 % similarity by DDH it did not
belong to any of the recognized Brachyspira species (range 16–64 % similarity).
This was further supported by average nucleotide identity values. Phylogenetic
analysis performed using housekeeping genes and core genomes of all valid
Brachyspira sp. and “B. hampsonii” revealed that B. suanatina and B. intermedia
formed a clade distinct from B. hyodysenteriae. By comparing the genomes of the
three closely related species B. intermedia, B. hyodysenteriae and B. suanatina
similar profiles of general genomic features and distribution of genes in
different functional categories were obtained. However, the genome size of
B. hyodysenteriae was smallest among the species, suggesting the possibility of
reductive evolution in the divergence of this species. A bacteriophage region
and a putative plasmid sequence were also found in the genome of B. suanatina
strain AN4859/03.

**Conclusions**  
The results of our study suggest that despite being similar to B. hyodysenteriae
phenotypically, B. suanatina should be regarded as a separate species based on
its genetic characteristics. Based on characteristics presented in this report
we propose that strains AN4859/03, AN1681:1/04, AN2384/04 and Dk12570-2 from
pigs in Sweden and Denmark, and strains AN3949:2/02 and AN1418:2/01 isolated
from mallards in Sweden, represent a unique species within genus Brachyspira.
For this new species we propose the name B. suanatina for which the type strain
is AN4859/03T (=ATCC® BAA-2592™ = DSM 100974T).
