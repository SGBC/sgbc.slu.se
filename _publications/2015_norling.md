### Abstract

**Background**  
There are no commercially available vaccines against human protozoan parasitic
diseases, despite the success of vaccination-induced long-term protection
against infectious diseases. East Coast fever, caused by the protist Theileria
parva, kills one million cattle each year in sub-Saharan Africa, and contributes
significantly to hunger and poverty in the region. A highly effective, live,
multi-isolate vaccine against T. parva exists, but its component isolates have
not been characterized. Here we sequence and compare the three component T.
parva stocks within this vaccine, the Muguga Cocktail, namely Muguga, Kiambu5
and Serengeti-transformed, aiming to identify genomic features that contribute
to vaccine efficacy.

**Results**  
We find that Serengeti-transformed, originally isolated from the wildlife
carrier, the African Cape buffalo, is remarkably and unexpectedly similar to
the Muguga isolate. The 420 detectable non-synonymous SNPs were distributed
among only 53 genes, primarily subtelomeric antigens and antigenic families.
The Kiambu5 isolate is considerably more divergent, with close to 40,000 SNPs
relative to Muguga, including >8,500 non-synonymous mutations distributed among
\>1,700 (42.5 %) of the predicted genes. These genetic markers of the component
stocks can be used to characterize the composition of new batches of the Muguga
Cocktail.

**Conclusions**  
Differences among these three isolates, while extensive, represent only a small
proportion of the genetic variation in the entire species. Given the efficacy
of the Muguga Cocktail in inducing long-lasting protection against infections
in the field, our results suggest that whole-organism vaccines against
parasitic diseases can be highly efficacious despite considerable genome-wide
differences relative to the isolates against which they protect.
