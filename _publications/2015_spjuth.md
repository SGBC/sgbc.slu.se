### Abstract

High-throughput technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, have turned
molecular biology into a data-intensive discipline, requiring bioinformaticians
to use high-performance computing resources and carry out data management and
analysis tasks on large scale. Workflow systems can be useful to simplify
construction of analysis pipelines that automate tasks, support reproducibility
and provide measures for fault-tolerance. However, workflow systems can incur
significant development and administration overhead so bioinformatics pipelines
are often still built without them. We present the experiences with workflows
and workflow systems within the bioinformatics community participating in a
series of hackathons and workshops of the EU COST action SeqAhead. The
organizations are working on similar problems, but we have addressed them with
different strategies and solutions. This fragmentation of efforts is
inefficient and leads to redundant and incompatible solutions. Based on our
experiences we define a set of recommendations for future systems to enable
efficient yet simple bioinformatics workflow construction and execution.
