### Abstract

We report the genome of a Staphylococcus aureus strain (ILRI_Eymole1/1)
isolated from a nasal swab of a dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) in North
Kenya. The complete genome sequence of this strain consists of a circular
chromosome of 2,874,302 bp with a GC-content of 32.88 %. In silico annotation
predicted 2755 protein-encoding genes and 76 non-coding genes. This isolate
belongs to MLST sequence type 30 (ST30). Phylogenetic analysis based on a
subset of 283 core genes revealed that it falls within the human clonal complex
30 (CC30) S. aureus isolate cluster but is genetically distinct. About 79 % of
the protein encoding genes are part of the CC30 core genome (genes common to
all CC30 S. aureus isolates), ~18 % were within the variable genome (shared
among multiple but not all isolates) and ~ 3 % were found only in the genome of
the camel isolate. Among the 85 isolate-specific genes, 79 were located within
putative phages and pathogenicity islands. Protein encoding genes associated
with bacterial adhesion, and secretory proteins that are essential components
of the type VII secretion system were also identified. The complete genome
sequence of S. aureus strain ILRI_Eymole1/1 has been deposited in the European
Nucleotide Archive under the accession no LN626917.1.
