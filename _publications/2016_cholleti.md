### Abstract

Mosquitoes carry a wide variety of viruses that can cause vector-borne
infectious diseases and affect both human and veterinary public health.
Although Mozambique can be considered a hot spot for emerging infectious
diseases due to factors such as a rich vector population and a close
vector/human/wildlife interface, the viral flora in mosquitoes have not
previously been investigated. In this study, viral metagenomics was employed to
analyze the viral communities in Culex and Mansonia mosquitoes in the Zambezia
province of Mozambique. Among the 1.7 and 2.6 million sequences produced from
the Culex and Mansonia samples, respectively, 3269 and 983 reads were
classified as viral sequences. Viruses belonging to the Flaviviridae,
Rhabdoviridae and Iflaviridae families were detected, and different
unclassified single- and double-stranded RNA viruses were also identified. A
near complete genome of a flavivirus, tentatively named Cuacua virus, was
obtained from the Mansonia mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analysis of this
flavivirus, using the NS5 amino acid sequence, showed that it grouped with
‘insect-specific’ viruses and was most closely related to Nakiwogo virus
previously identified in Uganda. Both mosquito genera had viral sequences
related to Rhabdoviruses, and these were most closely related to Culex
tritaeniorhynchus rhabdovirus (CTRV). The results from this study suggest that
several viruses specific for insects belonging to, for example, the
Flaviviridae and Rhabdoviridae families, as well as a number of unclassified
RNA viruses, are present in mosquitoes in Mozambique.
