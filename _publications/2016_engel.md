### Abstract

As pollinators, bees are cornerstones for terrestrial ecosystem stability and
key components in agricultural productivity. All animals, including bees, are
associated with a diverse community of microbes, commonly referred to as the
microbiome. The bee microbiome is likely to be a crucial factor affecting host
health. However, with the exception of a few pathogens, the impacts of most
members of the bee microbiome on host health are poorly understood. Further,
the evolutionary and ecological forces that shape and change the microbiome are
unclear. Here, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of the bee
microbiome, and we present challenges associated with its investigation. We
conclude that global coordination of research efforts is needed to fully
understand the complex and highly dynamic nature of the interplay between the
bee microbiome, its host, and the environment. High-throughput sequencing
technologies are ideal for exploring complex biological systems, including
host-microbe interactions. To maximize their value and to improve assessment
of the factors affecting bee health, sequence data should be archived, curated,
and analyzed in ways that promote the synthesis of different studies. To this
end, the BeeBiome consortium aims to develop an online database which would
provide reference sequences, archive metadata, and host analytical resources.
The goal would be to support applied and fundamental research on bees and their
associated microbes and to provide a collaborative framework for sharing
primary data from different research programs, thus furthering our
understanding of the bee microbiome and its impact on pollinator health.
