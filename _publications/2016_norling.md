### Abstract

Metagenomics, the sequence characterization of all genomes within a sample, is
widely used as a virus discovery tool as well as a tool to study viral
diversity of animals. Metagenomics can be considered to have three main steps;
sample collection and preparation, sequencing and finally bioinformatics.
Bioinformatic analysis of metagenomic datasets is in itself a complex process,
involving few standardized methodologies, thereby hampering comparison of
metagenomics studies between research groups. In this publication the new
bioinformatics framework MetLab is presented, aimed at providing scientists
with an integrated tool for experimental design and analysis of viral
metagenomes. MetLab provides support in designing the metagenomics experiment
by estimating the sequencing depth needed for the complete coverage of a
species. This is achieved by applying a methodology to calculate the
probability of coverage using an adaptation of Stevens’ theorem. It also
provides scientists with several pipelines aimed at simplifying the analysis
of viral metagenomes, including; quality control, assembly and taxonomic
binning. We also implement a tool for simulating metagenomics datasets from
several sequencing platforms. The overall aim is to provide virologists with
an easy to use tool for designing, simulating and analyzing viral metagenomes.
The results presented here include a benchmark towards other existing software,
with emphasis on detection of viruses as well as speed of applications. This is
packaged, as comprehensive software, readily available for Linux and OSX users
at https://github.com/norling/metlab.
