### Abstract

Escherichia coli O103:H2 occurs as verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) carrying only
vtx 1 or vtx 2 or both variants, but also as vtx-negative atypical
enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC). The majority of E. coli O103:H2 identified
from cases of human disease are caused by the VTEC form. If aEPEC strains
frequently acquire verotoxin genes and become VTEC, they must be considered a
significant public health concern. In this study, we have characterized and
compared aEPEC and VTEC isolates of E. coli O103:H2 from Swedish cattle.
