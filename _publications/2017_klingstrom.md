### Abstract

When obtaining samples from biobanks, resolving ethical and legal concerns is a
time-consuming task where researchers need to balance the needs of privacy,
trust and scientific progress. The Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources
Research Infrastructure-Large Prospective Cohorts project has resolved numerous
such issues through intense communication between involved researchers and
experts in its mission to unite large prospective study sets in Europe. To
facilitate efficient communication, it is useful for nonexperts to have an at
least basic understanding of the regulatory system for managing biological
samples. Laws regulating research oversight are based on national law and
normally share core principles founded on international charters. In interview
studies among donors, chief concerns are privacy, efficient sample utilization
and access to information generated from their samples. Despite a lack of clear
evidence regarding which concern takes precedence, scientific as well as public
discourse has largely focused on privacy concerns and the right of donors to
control the usage of their samples. It is therefore important to proactively
deal with ethical and legal issues to avoid complications that delay or prevent
samples from being accessed. To help biobank professionals avoid making
unnecessary mistakes, we have developed this basic primer covering the
relationship between ethics and law, the concept of informed consent and
considerations for returning findings to donors.
