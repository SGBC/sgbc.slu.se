### Abstract

**Background:** Ticks are primary vectors for many well-known disease-causing agents that affect human and animal populations globally such as tick-borne encephalitis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and African swine fever. In this study, viral metagenomics was used to identify what viruses are present in Rhipicephalus spp. ticks collected in the Zambezi Valley of Mozambique.  
**Methods:** The RNA was amplified with sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the Ion Torrent platform. The generated sequences were subjected to quality check and classfied by BLAST. CodonCode aligner and SeqMan were used to assemble the sequences.  
**Results:** The majority of viral sequences showed closest sequence identity to the Orthomyxoviridae family, although viruses similar to the Parvoviridae and Coronaviridae were also identified. Nearly complete sequences of five orthomyxoviral segments (HA, NP, PB1, PB2, and PA) were obtained and …
